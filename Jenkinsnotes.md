# 🧰 Jenkins – Full Detailed Notes (With Explanations)

---

## ✅ What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used mainly for **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**.

### 💡 Continuous Integration (CI)

* Developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository.
* Each integration is verified by an automated build and test.
* Ensures bugs are detected early.

### 💡 Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

* Builds from CI are automatically tested, packaged, and prepared for release.
* Jenkins can push these changes to production environments automatically (deployment) or semi-automatically (delivery).

### Why Jenkins?

* Saves time and reduces errors by automating repetitive tasks.
* Provides quick feedback to developers.
* Improves code quality and deployment speed.

## 🧩 Key Features

1. **Open Source**: Free to use, maintained by a large community.
2. **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS.
3. **Extensible**: Thousands of plugins are available to integrate with tools like Git, Docker, AWS, Maven, and more.
4. **Simple CI/CD Setup**: Easy to configure pipelines and automate builds, tests, and deployments.
5. **SCM Integration**: Works with Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, SVN, etc.
6. **Master-Agent Architecture**: You can run jobs on distributed systems.
7. **Pipeline as Code**: Create build/deploy logic using Jenkinsfile.

## 🔧 Jenkins Architecture

### 🖥 Components

1. **Jenkins Master (Controller)**

   * Main server responsible for:

     * Scheduling builds.
     * Managing agents.
     * Monitoring.
     * Hosting UI and REST APIs.
   * Also executes jobs if no agents are configured.

2. **Jenkins Agent (Slave)**

   * Executes the build jobs sent by the master.
   * Can be on separate machines or containers.
   * Useful for distributing workloads.

### Communication Methods:

* **SSH** – Common for Linux agents.
* **JNLP** – Java-based protocol.
* **WebSockets** – Recommended in modern versions.

---

## 💻 Jenkins Installation

### Prerequisites:

* Java JDK (Java 8, 11, or 17 depending on Jenkins version)
* Internet access for plugin downloads.

### Installation Methods:

1. **WAR File (Java Archive)**:

   ```bash
   java -jar jenkins.war
   ```

   * Starts Jenkins on `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Package Managers**:

   * Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```bash
     sudo apt install jenkins
     ```
   * CentOS/Red Hat:

     ```bash
     sudo yum install jenkins
     ```

3. **Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
   ```

   * Easiest and portable method.

---

## 🔐 Jenkins Initial Setup

1. After first launch, Jenkins asks for an **admin password** (stored in `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`).
2. Choose:

   * **Install suggested plugins** or
   * **Select plugins manually**
3. Create **admin user**
4. Jenkins is ready for jobs!

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration Workflow with Jenkins

### Typical CI Flow:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub/GitLab.
2. Jenkins gets notified via **Webhook** or by **Polling** SCM.
3. Jenkins:

   * Clones repository
   * Builds code (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm)
   * Runs automated tests
   * Produces and archives artifacts
   * Sends notifications (email, Slack)

---

## 🧪 Job Types in Jenkins

1. **Freestyle Project**

   * GUI-based job.
   * Supports SCM, build triggers, build steps, post-build actions.
   * Not versioned (unlike pipelines).

2. **Pipeline Project**

   * Allows you to define jobs using code (Jenkinsfile).
   * Supports complex flows and parallel stages.

3. **Multibranch Pipeline**

   * Automatically creates jobs for each branch in the repo.
   * Great for GitHub/GitLab integrations.

4. **Folder**

   * Organize multiple jobs under a logical group.

5. **Multi-configuration (Matrix) Project**

   * Run the same job with multiple configurations (e.g., OS, JDK versions).

---

## 📜 Jenkins Pipelines

### Two Types:

1. **Declarative Pipeline**:

   * Easier, YAML-like structure inside `pipeline { }`
   * Recommended for most users.

2. **Scripted Pipeline**:

   * More powerful, based on Groovy scripting.
   * Uses `node { }` and `stage { }` blocks.

### Benefits:

* Version control with `Jenkinsfile`.
* Easily repeatable and shareable.
* Supports variables, parameters, conditionals.

## 📄 Jenkinsfile Explained

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Running Tests...'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploying to production'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* **agent any**: Run on any available executor.
* **stage**: Logical section of the build.
* **steps**: Actual shell or script steps to run.

## 🔌 Jenkins Plugins

### Purpose:

Extend Jenkins functionality to:

* Connect with SCM, tools, cloud providers, etc.
* Enhance UI.
* Add authentication providers.

### Common Plugins:

* **Git Plugin** – Clone and poll Git repos.
* **Pipeline** – Required for Jenkinsfile jobs.
* **Blue Ocean** – Modern UI for pipelines.
* **Email Extension** – Custom email notifications.
* **Docker Pipeline** – Work with Docker containers.
* **Slack Notification** – Alert builds to Slack channels.

---

## 🔁 Source Code Management (SCM)

Jenkins integrates with:

* Git (most popular)
* GitHub / GitLab
* Bitbucket
* Subversion

### Example Checkout in Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
git url: 'https://github.com/username/repo.git', branch: 'main'
```

---

## 📤 CI/CD Integration Tools

### Deployment:

* **Docker**: Build and push images.
* **Kubernetes**: Deploy YAMLs or Helm charts.
* **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Deploy to cloud using CLI tools or plugins.
* **Ansible**: Trigger playbooks from Jenkins.
* **FTP/SCP/SSH**: Transfer files to servers.

### Notifications:

* Slack
* Email
* Microsoft Teams
* Webhooks

---

## 🔐 Jenkins Security

### Key Concepts:

1. **Users & Roles**: Use Matrix-based or Role Strategy Plugin.
2. **Credentials**:

   * Add Git tokens, SSH keys, passwords securely.
   * Use `withCredentials` in pipelines.
3. **Authentication Integration**:

   * LDAP, Active Directory, GitHub OAuth.

### Example:

```groovy
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-creds', passwordVariable: 'PASS', usernameVariable: 'USER')]) {
    sh 'echo $USER && echo $PASS'
}
```

---

## 📁 Managing Jenkins

### Backup:

* Backup `$JENKINS_HOME` directory regularly.

  * Contains jobs, configs, user data.
* Use plugins like:

  * **ThinBackup**
  * **SCM Sync Configuration**

### Logs:

* Job-specific: Inside job folders.
* System logs: Manage Jenkins → System Log.

### Upgrading:

* Replace WAR file or update via `apt/yum`.

---

## 📈 Monitoring Jenkins

* **Built-in**: Monitor build history, job logs.
* **Advanced**:

  * Integrate with **Prometheus** plugin.
  * Visualize metrics in **Grafana**.
  * Use **Audit Trail Plugin** for security logging.

---

## 🧠 Jenkins Best Practices

1. Use **Jenkinsfile** to version control jobs.
2. Avoid **Freestyle jobs** for complex flows.
3. Use **parameters** for reusable pipelines.
4. Store **credentials** securely.
5. Use **folders** and **views** for organization.
6. Keep Jenkins and plugins **updated**.
7. Avoid running jobs on the **master node**.
8. Regularly **backup and monitor logs**.
